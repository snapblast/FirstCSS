# FirstCSS
My first code to understand styling rules.
It is recommended to start coding using the simplest editor. Hence I used Notepad++, as its a convinient editor.
This tutorial is for absolute beginner, hence it helps u understand the basic rules of CSS. Wink.. Wink!
The re a set of 7 steps, that I have followed:
1. Adding the basic HTML page: <head> & <body> tags and preparing the boiler-plate code for html.
2. Add the spash of color! :) One easy thing we can do to make the page more stylish is adding the colors. I started with stylesheet embedded inside the HTML file itself.
<style type="text/css"> </style> in the head tage after title. I added the text color and background.
3. Extending the the existing style- Add fonts: Another easy-breezy thing to make some beautiful distinction is to add fonts for various elements of the page. So I have added the font-family for default text as "Georgia" and heading element is "Helvetica".
4. A navigation bar: I have added styling to navingation bar instead of previously ugly-set of list view. Added padding to distict clearly the text and navigation bar. Added styling to the navigation itself.
5. Styling Links: Differentiating between visited links and not visited links using pseudo-class concept in css.
6: Added the Horizontal line acts as polite footer to the webpage.
7. Finally take it away from HTML: I made a separate file for the css as the styling might grow and it would be too unorganised to put all of them in html.
This is how you add external link of css file in an html file. 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
This will tell the browser that the style sheet is found in the file called “mystyle.css” and since no directory is mentioned, the browser will look in the same directory where it found the HTML file.
